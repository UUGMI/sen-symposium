# Software with Energy - Patricia Lago

With the increasing role played by software in supporting our society, its sustainability and environmental impact have become major factors in the development and operation of software-intensive systems. Myths and beliefs hide the real truth behind 'green IT': IT is energy-inefficient because software is developed to make it so - intentionally or not.
But how far are we from being able to control software energy-efficiency? What makes software greener? How can we transform measuring software energy consumption in a general practice? What architectural design decisions will result in more sustainable systems? How can we ensure that new-generation software will be both cloud-ready and environmental-friendly? and How can we make evident the economic and social impact of developing software with 'energy in mind'? These are a few of the research questions for a more sustainable digital society. This talk will discuss them, hence drawing directions for promising research.
