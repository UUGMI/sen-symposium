### Quantifying the Impact of Software

To develop a better quantitative understanding of software’s impact on different industries, we started a series of columns in IEEE Software in 2010. Senior managers and software professionals from companies such as Oracle, Microsoft, JPL, Philips, Hitachi and Shell have published a total of 30 columns so far. The Presentation summarizes what we’ve learned and will discuss some practical metrics that have surfaced such as the compound annual growth rate for software and software mileage. Implications for software engineers, managers and industries will be addressed.
