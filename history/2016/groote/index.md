### Jan Friso Groote

Prof.dr.ir. J.F. Groote (1965) studied computer science at Twente University
(at that time Technische Hogeschool Twente), obtained a PhD at the
University of Amsterdam on research executed at the Centre for Mathematics
and Computer Science in Amsterdam. Since 1997 he is working at
Eindhoven University of Technology where he occupies a chair in
software modelling and verification.

### Modelling and analysis of software before construction pays off.

In other engineering disciplines it is very common. Before an artefact is
constructed, architects and engineers have created many models of the
object-to-be-built. These models are used to understand it
thoroughly to guarantee that once the artefact is constructed, it functions as desired.

In software constructions models are uncommon, and if they exist, are
often verbose and imprecise. We will show that software can be built by
first making formal models and analysing these.  Measurements from industrial
application shows that the number of bugs during construction can be reduced ten fold, and
the total time to construct the artefact can be reduced with a factor 3.
