### Frits Vaandrager

Prof. Frits Vaandrager is full professor and principal investigator
within the Institute for Computing and Information Sciences of the
Radboud University Nijmegen. He received his PhD from the University of
Amsterdam in 1990. After postdoc positions at MIT and at the Ã‰cole des
Mines, he was group leader at the CWI in Amsterdam until his appointment
in Nijmegen in 1995. Vaandrager has a strong interest in the development
and application of theory, (formal) methods and tools for the
specification and analysis of computer based systems. He has been and is
involved in a large number of projects in which formal verification,
model checking and automata learning technology are applied to tackle
practical problems from industrial partners. His publications have been
cited more than 7.500 times and his h-index according to Google Scholar
is 45. He is editor of the journals Information & Computation and
Logical Methods in Computer Science, and has been PC member of many
leading conferences in the field such as CAV, TACAS, CONCUR and RTSS.

###  Inference of State Machines

Active automata learning is emerging as a highly effective technique for
 obtaining state machine models of software components.
 In this talk, I will give a brief survey of recent progress in
 the field, highlight  applications in the area of
 communication protocols and control software, and
 identify some remaining research challenges.
