### Andy Zaidman

Andy is an associate professor in software engineering at the Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands. He obtained his MSc (2002) and PhD degree (2006) in Computer Science from the University of Antwerp, Belgium. His main research interests are software evolution, program comprehension, mining software repositories and software testing. Most of his work falls into the category of empirical software engineering as he is always trying to understand how people build software. He was the general chair of the 15th Working Conference on Reverse Engineering (WCRE 2008) held in Antwerp, Belgium, program co-chair of WCRE 2009 held in Lille, France and program co-chair of VISSOFT 2014 held in Victoria, BC, Canada. In 2013 Andy Zaidman was the laureate of a prestigious Vidi career grant from the Dutch science foundation NWO for his research proposal entitled TestRoots.


### Software Analytics: The Dark Side and the Test Side

How can we make a great software product? Over the last two decades or so, our understanding of how (not) to build software has dramatically increased. Unfortunately, these lessons have come at great cost as well. The cost of software projects that have completely failed, projects that have gone over budget and even software systems that were released, but that still contained defects that have caused life-threatening situations.

How can we make all that knowledge more actionable? What if we can rely on hard facts? What can recommenders do for us? What if we can do more then just act upon our senses? In this presentation, I will focus specifically on some surprising findings of our first steps in the area of software analytics for testing.
