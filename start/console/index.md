We currently only release alpha versions of Rascal, which are subject to
_frequent changes_.

Please make sure you have:

- a Java SDK 1.7 or higher installed and available. A Java run-time environment will not be enough.

Then download the fully contained jar file [here](http://www.example.com).

The command line of Rascal starts by running `java -Xmx1G -Xss32m -jar rascal-<version>.jar`.
