## Getting started with Rascal

### Downloading and installing
Rascal is currently in alpha stage. This means it is software that is subject to frequent change and generally unpolished.

 - We provide an [Eclipse plugin](/start/eclipse/) which includes everything
 - There is also a [Command line](/start/console/) version.

### First time

After you have downloaded Rascal, you might be interested in the first steps to executing some Rascal code.

 - Open the Rascal Perspective (use the "Open Perspective" button in the top-right of your screen)
 - Create a new Rascal project (use the "New..." button in the top-left of your screen, then select "Rascal Project" from the menu)
 - This should automatically open a new console with the new project on its search path
 - Type `1 + 1` after the `rascal>` prompt to see `2`
