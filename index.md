## The one-stop shop for metaprogramming

<p class="lead"> 

Rascal integrates all technological aspects for the creation of meta programs
into a single language.  Use it for any kind of metaprogramming task: to
construct parsers for programming languages, to analyze and transform source
code, or to define new DSLs with full IDE support.
<br>
<br>
Rascal is a programming language; such that meta programs
can be created by, understood by, and debugged by <strong>programmers</strong>.

<br>
<br>
Rascal primitives include context-free grammars, relations, relational calculus operators,
advanced patterns matching, generic type-safe traversal, comprehensions, concrete syntax for objects,
string templates for code generation, etc.
<br>
<br>

Rascal has libraries for integrating language front-ends, for reusing analysis
algorithms (such as SMT solvers), and for getting typed meta-data out of
version management systems, for interactive visualization, etc.
