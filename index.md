## Welcome to Rascal

<p class="lead">
	Rascal is a domain specific language for source code analysis and manipulation
	a.k.a. meta-programming. 
</p>

It is currently being developed and tested at CWI. No
formal release has been made yet, but we do provide alpha quality "previews" on
the [Getting started](/start/) page.
