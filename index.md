## Metaprogramming for the masses

<p class="lead"> 

Construct parsers for programming languages by writing declarative, modular grammars. Analyze and transform source code using a metaprogramming language with built-in support for traversal, querying, pattern matching and code generation. Use Rascal as a language workbench to define DSLs with full IDE support.

### A DSL in 36 lines of code

The following example shows how to define a simple DSL for state machines. It includes a parser, a check for unreachable states and a compiler to Java code. 

The grammar of the DSL is defined using Rascal's grammar formalism which is fully integrated in the language.

This grammar reuses identifier syntax and whitespace convention from the standard library. Each non-terminal defines a *type*. Parse trees are typed values like any other value in Rascal.

To check for unreachable states, we first create a binary relation between states. The first comprehension uses *concrete syntax* matching to find a state's transitions. The post-fix `+` computes the transitive closure of the relation. Then  we return all states are not reachable from the initial state.

There are various ways of compiling a DSL to target code in Rascal. The simplest is using string templates and generate code in a general purpose language. The following snippet shows the generation of a Java while loop to execute a state machine.

String templates allow arbitrary Rascal values and control-flow constructs to be interpolated in string literals. Note how this code does not use concrete matching, but instead uses the labels defined in the grammar (i.e., `states`, `out`, `event`, and `to`).

And that's it! A complete DSL in 36 lines of code. Of course, the parser and the `unreachable` and `compile` functions can be connected to the IDE. This provides custom syntax highlighting, error-marking and automatic building in state machine editors.
