## About Rascal

Rascal is a project by researchers in programming languages and software engineering. The core team is from Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI), and people from different institutes and universities have been and are contributing. See the [github contributors](https://github.com/cwi-swat/rascal/graphs/contributors) graphs and [ohloh](https://www.ohloh.net/p/rascal).

In principle Rascal is a research laboratory and research vehicle that is not intended for production use (yet). It has been and is used in serious projects however and we plan to stabilize the language eventually.

- Rascal is the successor of the [ASF+SDF Meta-Environment](http://www.meta-environment.org/).
- [Tobias Baanders](http://www.tobiasart.eu/) designed the Rascal logo.
- It employs a parsing architecture inspired by Scott and Johnstone's GLL parsing.

## Teaching

Rascal is taught at Universiteit van Amsterdam as part of the Master Software Engineering program, in a collaboration between UvA, HvA and VU:

 - In Software Evolution it is used to analyze, visualize and transform source code of legacy systems.
 - In Software Construction it is used to construct compilers for domain specific languages.

Rascal is also taught in the course Advanced Programming at Amsterdam University College. The course material can be found here.

At Open Universiteit (OU), Rascal is also taught for the lab of the course on Software Evolution.
