### Empirical Software Engineering, Stamp Collecting, and Design Science

In the past 20 years, empirical software engineering has developed into a discipline of its own, with an international researchers network (ISERN, started in 1993), its own journal (started in 1996) and a dedicated conference (started in  2007). This is strange, for scientific disciplines are usually defined by subject, not by research method. It feeds the misunderstanding that empirical software engineering collects facts rather than produces scientific theories, avoids the creation of useful designs, and imitates the sometimes questionable use of mathematics, in particular of statistics, in the social sciences.

In this talk I will take the point of view that software engineer research is a design science, and that, as all other design sciences, it should include both empirical studies and the design of useful artifacts, and should use mathematics to predict artifact properties. I will review some misconceptions held by designers about empirical research, by empirical researchers about design, and by mathematicians about themselves, or the other way around. In conclusion I will sketch a methodology for software engineering research that avoids these misconceptions and may be useful to raise the defensibility of software engineering research methodology with respect to neighboring disciplines.
